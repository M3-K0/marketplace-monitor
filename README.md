✅ **PWA Installation** - App can be installed on mobile devices  
✅ **Offline Support** - Basic functionality works offline  
✅ **Mock Data** - Demo listings appear when running searches  
✅ **Search Management** - Create, edit, delete searches  
✅ **Settings** - Configure app preferences  
✅ **Data Export/Import** - Backup and restore functionality  
✅ **Notifications** - Push notifications (when supported)  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Optimized for Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra  

## Testing the App

1. **Create a Search**:
   - Click "Add Search"
   - Enter keywords like "iPhone 15" or "MacBook Pro"
   - Set a location (for demo purposes)
   - Save the search

2. **Run the Search**:
   - Click the play button on a search card, or
   - Click "Run All Searches"
   - Wait for mock listings to appear

3. **Test PWA Features**:
   - Try installing the app on mobile
   - Test offline functionality
   - Check notifications (if supported)

## Notes

- **Mock Data**: The app primarily uses mock data for demonstration since real Facebook scraping is blocked
- **GitHub Pages Limitations**: Some PWA features may be limited in the GitHub Pages environment
- **Mobile Optimized**: Best experience on Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra or similar mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

If the app still doesn't work:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check Console**: Look for any remaining errors
3. **Test on Mobile**: PWA features work better on mobile devices
4. **Wait for Deployment**: GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to update

The app should now work properly as a demo PWA with mock marketplace data!
